# EVM - Electronic Voting Machine 

Our EVM project is an Electronic Voting Application that uses biometric authentication system for security. We further wanted to integrate with the aadhar card data but it was not possible as aadhar card data is confidential so, This prototype was made in order to throw a light on the idea to avoid false voting as Vote will not be casted if the person himself/herself is not present at the polling booth and a person can vote from any polling booth, there is no need for a person to be present on the specified polling booth.
